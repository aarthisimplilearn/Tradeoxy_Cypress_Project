Challenges while scripting

1. While running in cypress, complete page of the website is not visible. So it needs to change the viewport size from default(1000px*660px) to width:1280,height:720

2. When I try to sign in using google option during test execution, I could see the error message like "We're sorry, but you do not have access to this page." on the next page of the google option. But while accessing normally I could find our  gmail account to sign in.


3. When I try to enter the username and password and click on sign in button by accessing email option in sign in page, I am getting pop up with error message like wrong email or password even though they are vaild email id and password

4. Email to reset a password is not receiving after entering the email id and click on reset password button  

5. Element is present in the dom but when trying to locate the element using valid locators, i am getting error like Element not found
     eg: cy.get('a[href="/?scanner=crypto/"]')
         cy.get('a[href="/?scanner=stock/"]')
         cy.get('a[href="/?scanner=forex/"]')

   Above mentioned elemnts are present but couldn't find during execution

6. Logout function also not working properly during execution
